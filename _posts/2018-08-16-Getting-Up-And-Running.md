## Getting Started

So this is the first post of the first blog I've had, never used Jekyll before but make a small write up at some point going over what I've done and how. As that is going to be the point of this blog, its a place for me to write down what I've been doing and how I've done it. Sometimes a why, but mostly the why is because it looks interesting.

I like to code, and dabble in a few languages but its all as a hobby. My main language is PYTHON

```python
print("hello World!")
```

have done some things with the p5.js framework when watching [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman) but don't do much with front end web dev so my html and javascript or pretty rubbish. So thank goodness for Jekyll as this isn't so bad at all, make web pages by scripting them up I like it.

Anyway, this was just to get things up and running and to make sure it works. More to be added later
